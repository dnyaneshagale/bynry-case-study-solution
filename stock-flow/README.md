## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Entity Relationship Diagram

The application uses the following data model:

- **Company**: Central entity that owns products and warehouses
- **Product**: Items that can be stocked, with details like SKU and supplier
- **ProductType**: Categories of products with specific low-stock thresholds
- **Warehouse**: Physical locations where inventory is stored
- **Inventory**: Junction entity tracking product stock in specific warehouses
- **Supplier**: Vendors who provide products for reordering

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Business Rules

1. **Low Stock Determination**:
    - Products are considered low stock when their current quantity falls below the threshold defined for their product type
    - Only products with recent sales activity generate alerts
    - The system calculates days until stockout based on average daily usage

2. **Warehouse Management**:
    - The same product can be stored in multiple warehouses
    - Each warehouse belongs to a specific company
    - Stock levels are tracked per warehouse

3. **Supplier Information**:
    - Every product is associated with a supplier
    - Supplier contact information is included in alerts to facilitate reordering

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Initialization Error**:
    - If you encounter errors related to table not found during startup, ensure that `spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true` is set in your `application.properties`

2. **Hibernate Entity Issues**:
    - If you experience entity mapping problems, verify that your entity relationships are correctly defined with proper cascade types and fetch strategies.
